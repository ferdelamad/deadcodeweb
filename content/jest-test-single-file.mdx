## How to get coverage for one file with Jest

It is common to have rules within our collaboration systems that prevent us from pushing code that decreases the current overall coverage of our application. 
Therefore you may need a coverage report for only the one file that you are modifying.

Other times you have the luxury to pay some tech debt and have the opportunity to enhance your current test. In such cases, having metrics to gauge your efforts becomes handy.

In any case, you can collect coverage from a single test file using the following command:
`jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom=<path-to-file(s)-to-collect-coverge>`

****There is a catch, if you happen to use a **test script** from your package.json, for example:

```json
"test": "jest --config ./jest.config.js"
```

There will be a difference on how you run this script between **npm** and **yarn**.

**Npm**

`npm test <path-to-test-file> -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom=<path-to-file(s)-to-collect-coverge>`

**Yarn**

`yarn test <path-to-test-file> --coverage --collectCoverageFrom=<path-to-file(s)-to-collect-coverge>`

The main difference is that npm needs the extra `--` before `--coverage`. This is a requirement for npm to include the Jest CLI options.

Additionally file paths should always be relative to the project root folder.

Example:

`npm test src/app/__tests__/page.test.tsx -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom=src/app/page.tsx`

The above command will print a coverage summary only for the `page.tsx` component.
